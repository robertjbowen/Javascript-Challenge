# Javascript-Challenge

***

The purpose of this challenge is to create JavaScript code to import a dataset, create lists to enable user input, provide list filtering functionality and generate html code to display the outputs through an html web interface based on user event triggers.  

***

### Documents in this repository are:

1. UFO-level-1 directory - Folder containing all of the project code for Automatic table and date Search capabilities

	* index.html - This is the html code to generate the web Landing Page called by the index app in MarsApp.

	* ststic directory - folder containing the html files

		* css directory/ style.css - This is the html code to generate the display styling for the web interface.

		* images directory - contains images called by index.html for display on the webpage background

		* js directory - contains the javascript files 

			* data.js - javascript file containing the input data set to be displayed and filtered

			* app.js - javasrcipt file containg functions and event triggers to read data.js, filter the data set based on user defined date inputs, and generate the html code to display the output table 

2. UFO-level-2 directory - Folder containing the optional project code for multiple search categories

	* All subfolders and files are the same as in the UFO-level-1 directory with changes made only to index.html, images directory, and app.js.

3. images directory - contains images of the WebPage outputs for display in this ReadMe
